	abstract = {Python for Data Analysis is concerned with the nuts and bolts of manipulating, processing, cleaning, and crunching data in Python. It is also a practical, modern introduction to scientific computing in Python, tailored for data-intensive applications. This is a book about the parts of the Python language and libraries you’ll need to effectively solve a broad set of data analysis problems. This book is not an exposition on analytical methods using Python as the implementation language. Written by Wes {McKinney}, the main author of the pandas library, this hands-on book is packed with practical cases studies. It’s ideal for analysts new to Python and for Python programmers new to scientific computing.  Use the {IPython} interactive shell as your primary development environment Learn basic and advanced {NumPy} (Numerical Python) features Get started with data analysis tools in the pandas library Use high-performance tools to load, clean, transform, merge, and reshape data Create scatter plots and static or interactive visualizations with matplotlib Apply the pandas groupby facility to slice, dice, and summarize datasets Measure data by points in time, whether it’s specific instances, fixed periods, or intervals Learn how to solve problems in web analytics, social sciences, finance, and economics, through detailed examples},

	abstract = {For many researchers, Python is a first-class tool mainly because of its libraries for storing, manipulating, and gaining insight from data. Several resources exist for individual pieces of this data science stack, but only with the Python Data Science Handbook do you get them all—{IPython}, {NumPy}, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and other related tools.Working scientists and data crunchers familiar with reading and writing Python code will find this comprehensive desk reference ideal for tackling day-to-day issues: manipulating, transforming, and cleaning data; visualizing different types of data; and using data to build statistical or machine learning models. Quite simply, this is the must-have reference for scientific computing in Python.With this handbook, you’ll learn how to use:{IPython} and Jupyter: provide computational environments for data scientists using {PythonNumPy}: includes the ndarray for efficient storage and manipulation of dense data arrays in {PythonPandas}: features the {DataFrame} for efficient storage and manipulation of labeled/columnar data in {PythonMatplotlib}: includes capabilities for a flexible range of data visualizations in {PythonScikit}-Learn: for efficient and clean Python implementations of the most important and established machine learning algorithms},
